# eeg2d - extended euclidian 2d geometry for JavaScript

This package contains a library being to able to manipulate 2d objects in the euclidian space.
The biggest advantage of this library is a very powerful representation of 2d linear transformations. It is possible
to represent any linear transformation while being able to decompose it into the basic transformation as
translate, rotate, scale and skew.

The pakcage is unfortunately not yet documented. But the intention is to document it as soon as possible.
